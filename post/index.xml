      <description>Hello üëã Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Darren! I am a sysadmin. Meaning I have a lot of servers that I rent for testing and development. I also have a discord music bot Model Buses that uses lavalink.
Having one lavalink server isn&amp;rsquo;t enough&amp;hellip;. jk it&amp;rsquo;s prob enough, but I like to have a few more for redundancy.
As of writing this, my bot model buses are on 97 guilds, which isn&amp;rsquo;t that much.</description>

2. Investigate Problem So first thing I do was check Cloudflare logs, see what traffic is going trough and see if Cloudflare was blocking it.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: Don‚Äôt use it to host video, theres nothing preventing you from doing so other than Cloudflare tos (2.8) but it‚Äôs better if you just use it for image storage.
 Hello there üëã Today we will use Cloudflare &amp;amp; GitLab to make the best ‚Äúfree‚Äù &amp;amp; fast CDN!
How do we do this you may ask, well simple. GitLab provides us with 10 GB repository limit, we can use this to host our original data via GitLab Pages, then we serve it via Cloudflare, and we set a page rule for our CDN, so it always hit the cached version!</description>

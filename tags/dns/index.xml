      <description>Disclaimer: Don‚Äôt use it to host video, theres nothing preventing you from doing so other than Cloudflare tos (2.8) but it‚Äôs better if you just use it for image storage.
 Hello there üëã Today we will use Cloudflare &amp;amp; GitLab to make the best ‚Äúfree‚Äù &amp;amp; fast CDN!
How do we do this you may ask, well simple. GitLab provides us with 10 GB repository limit, we can use this to host our original data via GitLab Pages, then we serve it via Cloudflare, and we set a page rule for our CDN, so it always hit the cached version!</description>
